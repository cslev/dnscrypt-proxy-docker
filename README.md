# dnscrypt-proxy-docker
DNScrypt-proxy in a container

# Aim
This image is neither for industrial nor for personal use. If you want a light-weight version of a containerized DNScrypt-proxy, use [klutchell's work](https://github.com/klutchell/dnscrypt-proxy-docker).
This image for research purpose only, using a heavier-weight base image to have better interaction with the container, e.g., standard debian networking tools, BASH access, save and store SSL keys for decrypting communication.
